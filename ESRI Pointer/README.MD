=====================================
ESRI Pointer
=====================================

This tool was designed for the purpose of acting as a location pointer during powerpoint presentations, where a laser pointer could not be used due to poor visibility. A pre-defined set of existing circular cursors have been defined with the basic colors for the user to select from. Alternatively, the user can also define their own cursors and utilize those.
